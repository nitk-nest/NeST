# This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1` and
# `h2` via two routers `r1` and `r2`. Traceroute is run from h1 to an interface
# of h2. It is similar to `static-routing-point-to-point-3.py` available in
# `examples/static-routing` , the only difference is that traceroute is used
# instead of ping.
