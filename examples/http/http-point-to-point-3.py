# This program emulates a Local Area Network (LAN). Four hosts: `h1` to `h4`
# are connected using a switch `s1`. Here, H4 is taken as the HTTP Server and
# H1, H2, H3 act as HTTP Clients. They generate load for the H$ server with
# varying number of connections and rate. The results of this HTTP experiment
# will be documented in the "examples/<Exp Name>(<Timestamp>)_dump" folder.
