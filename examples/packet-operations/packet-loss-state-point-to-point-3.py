# This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1` and
# `h2` via two routers `r1` and `r2`. 20 ping packets are sent from `h1` to
# `h2`, and the success/failure of these packets is reported. It is similar to
# `ah-point-to-point-3.py` in `examples/address-helpers`. This program shows
# how to add an loss probability using markov model having four states to the packets outgoing from the
# chosen network interface.
