def exec_subprocess_in_background(
    cmd, shell=False, wait_for_exit_code=False, exit_text=None, timeout=5
):
    """
    Executes a command in the background. This is mainly for
    commands or programs that have an event loop running,
    like server components of networking tools, that need to be
    run in the background so that NeST is uninterrupted.

    If a custom program is to be run using the command,
    the `wait_for_exit_code` parameter can be set to true,
    requiring the custom program to not print anything to
    stdout except the string 'Process successful\n' when
    it can be confirmed that the process has run successfully
    till the point of the event loop. This signifies a success
    in running the process.

    If `wait_for_exit_code` is set to False, the function always
    returns 0 as the exit code, indicating success. This is used
    in situations where the above condition of printing only
    'Process successful\n' to stdout is not possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cmd : str
        command to be executed
    shell : boolean
        Spawns a shell and executes the command if true
        (Default value = False)
    wait_for_exit_code: boolean
        To wait or not to wait for a success message from
        the subprocess
    wait_text: str
        The text to look for in the output of the command
        (Default value = None)
    timeout: int
        The maximum time to wait for the process to complete
